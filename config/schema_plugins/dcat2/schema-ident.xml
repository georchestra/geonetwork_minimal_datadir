  <gns:title xml:lang="en">Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2</gns:title>
  <gns:description xml:lang="en">DCAT enables a publisher to describe datasets and data services in a catalog using a standard model
    and vocabulary that facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata from multiple catalogs. This can
    increase the discoverability of datasets and data services. It also makes it possible to have a decentralized
    approach to publishing data catalogs and makes federated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites
    possible using the same query mechanism and structure. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file as part
    of the digital preservation process.
